# fish-lesspipe - syntax coloring in less

This is a super simple fisher package that sets some variables for syntax coloring in less. It uses `pygmentize` if exists, `code2color` if not.

## Installation

You really shouldn't be using this unless you want a `config.fish`less config like me.

``` shell
$ fisher add pcr910303/fish-lesspipe
```
